\section*{About Allion}
Allion was established in 1991. Through custom test plans and automation, Allion
offers engineering services for performance and compliance testing. 
The specialty of the lab in Beaverton is advanced Wi-Fi testing. For performance
testing, there is an anechoic chamber and other equipment that allows isolation
of signal. Using attenuation simulators, several use cases can be tested 
in-depth.

\section*{My Role at Allion}
Projects at Allion coincide with contracts from third parties. Often these
projects involve testing a new product from those companies. I worked on a
couple of those projects, but worked on side projects as well when we were
between contracts. I developed automation for the attenuation equipment, and
wrote full tests that used that automation. My mentor Chad was extremely 
helpful, always willing to teach me about wireless technology and testing.\\
\\
Rather than having departments, Allion is split into teams per project. When I
first started my internship I started out helping analyze results from the last 
round of testing for the Nook Color, when it was still pre-release. When that
project ended I did independent work until another testing contract started
later on in my internship.

\section*{The Projects I Participated In}
\begin{itemize}
\item Nook Color
\item Writing a Python library for the Azimuth Adept-N
\item Writing a Python library for the Azimuth Ace
\item Writing Automated Testing which employs the Adept-N and Ace
\item Super Top Secret new product testing from a new startup company
\item Super Top Secret new product testing for Amazon
\end{itemize}
